A Simple And Responsive Website Made With HTML And CSS
This was made from a tutorial i watched my Brad Traversy. The link: https://youtu.be/Wm6CUkswsNw
I changed some codes in the style.css file. Like the floats he added in the boxes on the index.html i changed them to grids, also the article and aside in the about.html i also changed them to grid and finally the article and aside "form" in the services.html to girds. 
You can run the codes by clonning the code into a folder and import on your code editor.
Thank You And Enjoy!!
